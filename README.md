## PC Medlink - Peace Corps Medical Supplies

As seen on the White House Office of Science and Technology Blog: [Keeping Volunteers Healthy One Text at a Time](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/31/keeping-peace-corps-volunteers-healthy-one-text-time-0)
This project grew out of a [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/). You can see a live version of the site at [pcmedlink.org](http://pcmedlink.org).

### Developing locally

If you have any questions at all, feel free to email [James](https://github.com/jamesdabbs) or post on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/atlrug-rhok).

To get started with a local copy of the project, run

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:atlrug-rhok/medlink.git
$ bundle --without production
$ rake db:setup
```

*Optional* admin setup. Make sure git is [configured](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) globally as this becomes your admin username. 

```bash
$ rake admin:create
```

and you should be off to the races. You can check your setup by running the specs with

```bash
$ rake spec
```

If it's green, you should be good to go.

Then create a pull request and we will review it and merge it into the repo.
We also use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/atlrug-rhok/medlink) for Continuous
Integration.
